When files are modified in this session:

- If `.claude-context.md` changes: Re-read it immediately and update your understanding
- If service files in `SteelEstimation.Core/` change: Check if tests need updates
- If Blazor components change: Verify SignalR integration if needed
- If entity/DTO files change: Check if migrations are needed

Always stay aware of the latest commit context and how file changes relate to current development focus.
