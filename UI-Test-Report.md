# Steel Estimation Platform UI Test Report

## Test Date: July 31, 2025

## Executive Summary

The Steel Estimation Platform is running on `http://localhost:8080` (not the documented HTTPS port 5001). The application is experiencing database issues that prevent the login page from loading properly.

## Test Results

### 1. **Application Connectivity**
- ✅ Application is accessible on **http://localhost:8080**
- ❌ HTTPS endpoint (https://localhost:5001) is not responding
- ✅ Server: Kestrel (ASP.NET Core)
- ✅ Application type: Blazor Server + Razor Pages

### 2. **Login Page Status**
- ❌ **Login page returns HTTP 500 Internal Server Error**
- ❌ Cannot access login form due to database error
- Error: `Invalid object name 'OAuthProviderSettings'`

### 3. **Database Issue Identified**

The application is failing with the following error:
```
Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlException (0x80131904): 
Invalid object name 'OAuthProviderSettings'.
```

This indicates that the database is missing the `OAuthProviderSettings` table, which is required for the multi-authentication feature.

### 4. **Other Endpoints Status**
- ✅ Main page (`/`) - Returns 200 OK (Blazor content)
- ✅ Projects (`/Projects`) - Returns 200 OK
- ✅ Customers (`/Customers`) - Returns 200 OK
- ✅ Dashboard (`/Dashboard`) - Returns 200 OK
- ✅ API Auth (`/api/auth/login`) - Returns 200 OK

### 5. **Application Architecture Confirmed**
- Frontend: Blazor Server + Razor Pages
- Authentication: Cookie-based (8-hour session timeout)
- Version: 2.0 - Razor Pages
- Database: SQL Server (with connection issues)

## Root Cause Analysis

The login functionality is broken due to a missing database migration. The application expects an `OAuthProviderSettings` table that doesn't exist in the current database schema.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Run Database Migrations**
   ```powershell
   cd SteelEstimation.Web
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

2. **Check for Missing Migrations**
   - Look for any unapplied migrations related to OAuth/Social login features
   - The `OAuthProviderSettings` table needs to be created

3. **Verify Database Connection**
   - Ensure SQL Server is running
   - Check connection string in `appsettings.Development.json`
   - Verify the database exists and is accessible

### Testing Steps After Fix:

1. Once migrations are applied, the login page should load without errors
2. Test login with credentials:
   - Email: `admin@steelestimation.com`
   - Password: `Admin@123`
3. Verify navigation to dashboard after successful login
4. Test logout functionality

## Technical Details

### Application Stack:
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core 8.0
- **Frontend**: Blazor Server + Razor Pages
- **Database**: SQL Server 2022
- **Authentication**: Cookie-based with multi-auth support
- **Server**: Kestrel

### Login Flow:
1. GET `/Account/Login` - Display login form
2. POST `/Account/Login` - Submit credentials
3. Cookie authentication with 8-hour sliding expiration
4. Redirect to dashboard on success

## Conclusion

The Steel Estimation Platform is deployed and running, but has a critical database schema issue preventing login functionality. This appears to be a missing migration for the OAuth/multi-authentication feature. Once the database migration is applied, the login system should function normally.

The application architecture is sound and other endpoints are responding correctly, indicating the issue is isolated to the missing database table.
