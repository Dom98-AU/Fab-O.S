# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

Your project is now ready to be pushed to GitHub! Follow these steps to create and push to your new repository.

## 📝 Repository Creation Steps

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `steel-estimation-docker` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "Docker-ready Steel Estimation Platform built with ASP.NET Core 8.0 and Blazor Server"
   - **Visibility**: Choose Private or Public based on your needs
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

3. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Your Local Repository

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you quick setup instructions. Use these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace [your-username] with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/[your-username]/steel-estimation-docker.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If you're using GitHub CLI:
```bash
gh repo create steel-estimation-docker --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

### 3. Configure Repository Settings

After pushing, configure these settings on GitHub:

#### Secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions)
Add these repository secrets for GitHub Actions:
- `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` (if deploying to Azure)
- `DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` (if using a private registry)
- Any other deployment credentials

#### Branch Protection (Settings → Branches)
For the `main` branch:
- ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ✅ Include administrators

#### GitHub Pages (Optional - Settings → Pages)
If you want to host documentation:
- Source: Deploy from a branch
- Branch: main
- Folder: /docs (create if needed)

### 4. Set Up Environments (Settings → Environments)

Create these environments:
- **staging**: For development/testing
- **production**: For live deployment

Add protection rules and secrets specific to each environment.

## 🚀 First Push Checklist

Before pushing, ensure:
- ✅ All sensitive files are in .gitignore
- ✅ No hardcoded passwords or secrets in code
- ✅ Database backup files are excluded
- ✅ Local configuration files are not included

## 📋 After Push Tasks

1. **Check GitHub Actions**
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Verify CI workflow runs successfully
   - Fix any issues that arise

2. **Update Repository Settings**
   - Add topics: `aspnet-core`, `blazor`, `docker`, `sql-server`, `steel-estimation`
   - Add a license if needed
   - Configure Dependabot for security updates

3. **Documentation**
   - Update README with build status badges
   - Add contribution guidelines
   - Create issue templates

## 🔧 Useful Git Commands

```bash
# Check current status
git status

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Push a new branch
git push -u origin feature/new-feature

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Stash changes temporarily
git stash

# Apply stashed changes
git stash pop
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
If you get authentication errors:
```bash
# For HTTPS
git config --global credential.helper manager

# For SSH (recommended)
# 1. Generate SSH key: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
# 2. Add to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys
# 3. Update remote: git remote set-url origin git@github.com:[username]/steel-estimation-docker.git
```

### Large File Issues
If you have files larger than 100MB:
```bash
# Install Git LFS
git lfs install

# Track large files
git lfs track "*.bak"
git add .gitattributes

# Then commit and push
```

## 📞 Next Steps

1. Share repository with team members
2. Set up CI/CD pipelines
3. Configure deployment environments
4. Start creating issues and milestones

Good luck with your project! 🚀
