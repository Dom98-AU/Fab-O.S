# Staging Environment Status

## Completed Setup
✅ Created sandbox database (sqldb-steel-estimation-sandbox)
✅ Created staging slot on App Service
✅ Configured staging slot for .NET 8
✅ Set up environment variables (ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Staging)
✅ Configured connection string to sandbox database
✅ Created deployment management UI at /admin/deployment
✅ Integrated GitHub service for version tracking
✅ Created deployment scripts

## Current Issues
❌ Staging site returns 503 Service Unavailable
❌ Application binaries not properly deployed to staging slot

## Root Cause
The staging slot doesn't have the compiled application files. The deployment that ran earlier today succeeded but the files aren't starting properly.

## Resolution Steps Needed
To get staging working, you need to:

1. **Build the application locally**:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Steel Estimation Platform\SteelEstimation"
   dotnet publish SteelEstimation.Web\SteelEstimation.Web.csproj -c Release -o publish
   ```

2. **Deploy to staging using PowerShell**:
   ```powershell
   .\deploy-staging.ps1
   ```

3. **Or deploy using Azure CLI**:
   ```bash
   # Create a zip of the publish folder
   cd publish
   zip -r ../staging-deploy.zip .
   cd ..
   
   # Deploy the zip
   az webapp deployment source config-zip \
     --resource-group "NWIApps" \
     --name "app-steel-estimation-prod" \
     --slot "staging" \
     --src staging-deploy.zip
   ```

## Staging Environment Details
- **URL**: https://app-steel-estimation-prod-staging.azurewebsites.net
- **Database**: sqldb-steel-estimation-sandbox
- **Environment**: Staging
- **Runtime**: .NET 8.0 (64-bit)

## Deployment Management Features
Once staging is working, you can use the deployment management UI:
- **Access**: Navigate to `/admin/deployment` (requires Admin role)
- **Features**:
  - Side-by-side comparison of Production and Staging
  - View pending commits from GitHub
  - One-click promotion from Staging to Production
  - Deployment history tracking
  - Environment health monitoring

## Scripts Created
- `deploy-staging.ps1` - Deploy to staging slot
- `test-staging-config.ps1` - Test staging configuration
- `configure-staging-slot.ps1` - Configure staging settings
- `swap-slots.ps1` - Swap staging and production slots

The infrastructure is ready - you just need to deploy the compiled application to the staging slot.
