# Texture UI Test Guide

## What Was Fixed

The texture UI has been updated to show **actual robot previews with textures applied** instead of abstract pattern swatches, matching the DiceBear Bottts documentation.

### Key Changes:
1. **Single texture selection** (not multi-select - DiceBear only supports one texture at a time)
2. **Robot preview images** for each texture option showing the actual visual effect
3. **8 texture options**: circuits, circuits2, dots, grunge01, grunge02, grunge03, grunge04, grunge05
4. **Dynamic loading** - texture previews update when you change the base color

## Manual Testing Steps

### 1. Login
- URL: `http://localhost:8080`
- Email: `admin@steelestimation.com`
- Password: `Admin@123`

### 2. Navigate to Profile
- Click "My Profile" in the sidebar
- OR go directly to `http://localhost:8080/profile`

### 3. Open Avatar Editor
- Click the blue "Edit Profile" button on the right side of the profile header
- The modal should open with "Choose Your Avatar" title

### 4. Select Bottts Style (if not already selected)
- You should see two avatar options: Bottts (robot) and Initials
- Click on "Bottts" if not already selected

### 5. Go to Customize Tab (if tabs exist)
- If you see tabs like "Type" and "Customize", click "Customize"
- If no tabs, you should already see customization options

### 6. Check Texture Section
**What you should see:**
- A "Texture" label
- 8 texture option buttons in a grid (4 columns)
- Each button should show:
  - A small robot preview WITH that texture applied
  - The texture name below (circuits, circuits2, dots, grunge01-05)

**What you should NOT see:**
- Abstract patterns or colored rectangles
- Multiple checkmarks (it's single-select, not multi-select)
- "Clear All Textures" button

### 7. Test Texture Selection
1. Click on "circuits" texture
   - The button should become active (highlighted border)
   - The main avatar preview should update with the circuits texture
   
2. Click on "dots" texture
   - "circuits" should deselect
   - "dots" should become active
   - Main avatar shows dots texture

3. Try other textures (grunge01, grunge02, etc.)
   - Each should show a different texture effect on the robot

### 8. Test Color Interaction
1. Change the "Base Color" (robot body color)
2. The texture preview images should update to show robots in the new color
3. The selected texture should remain selected

## Expected Results

✅ **CORRECT Implementation:**
- Each texture option shows a mini robot with that specific texture
- Clicking a texture updates the main avatar
- Only one texture can be selected at a time
- Texture previews are actual SVG robot images

❌ **WRONG (old) Implementation:**
- Abstract pattern swatches (lines, dots, gradients)
- Multi-select with checkmarks
- "Clear All Textures" button
- No robot images in texture options

## Files Changed

1. **`/SteelEstimation.Web/Components/EnhancedAvatarSelectorV2.razor`**
   - Removed multi-select logic
   - Added `LoadTexturePreview()` method to generate robot previews
   - Added `texturePreviewCache` for performance
   - Removed abstract CSS patterns
   - Updated UI to show robot images instead of patterns

2. **`/SteelEstimation.Web/Pages/UserProfile.razor`**
   - Added `StateHasChanged()` to ensure UI updates

## Troubleshooting

**If texture previews don't load:**
- Wait 5-10 seconds for them to generate
- They should show loading spinners while generating
- Try changing the base color to trigger a refresh

**If modal doesn't open:**
- Clear browser cache
- Try refreshing the page
- Make sure you're logged in properly

**If you see abstract patterns instead of robots:**
- The old code might be cached
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clear browser cache and cookies

## Browser Testing

Please test on:
- ✅ Chrome on Ubuntu (WSL/Docker)
- ✅ Firefox on Windows
- ✅ Chrome on Windows

Each browser should show the same robot preview images in the texture options.
