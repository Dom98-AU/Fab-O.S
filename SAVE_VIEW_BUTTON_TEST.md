# Save View Button Visibility Test Guide

## Changes Made
The save view buttons have been updated for better visibility:

### Before:
- Small buttons with only icons
- Used `btn-sm` class (small buttons)
- No text labels
- Less prominent styling

### After:
- **Larger buttons** - Removed `btn-sm` class for normal-sized buttons
- **Text labels** - Added descriptive text alongside icons:
  - "Save As New" (Primary blue button)
  - "Save" (Green success button)  
  - "Delete" (Red danger button)
- **Better layout** - Used flexbox with gap for proper spacing
- **Enhanced hover effects** - Buttons lift up slightly with shadow on hover
- **Responsive design** - Text hides on mobile to save space
- **Primary button styling** - "Save As New" uses primary brand color (#0d1a80)

## Test Steps

1. **Navigate to Customers Page**
   - Go to http://localhost:8080/customers
   - Look for the save view controls in the top toolbar

2. **Verify Button Visibility**
   - Confirm you can see three prominent buttons:
     - **Blue "Save As New" button** with plus icon
     - **Green "Save" button** with save icon
     - **Red "Delete" button** with trash icon
   - Each button should have both an icon AND text label

3. **Test Hover Effects**
   - Hover over each button
   - Buttons should slightly lift up with a shadow effect
   - Colors should become slightly darker on hover

4. **Test Responsive Design**
   - Resize browser window to mobile size
   - Button text should hide, showing only icons
   - Buttons should remain visible and usable

5. **Test Functionality**
   - Click "Save As New" - modal should appear
   - With a view selected, click "Save" - should update the view
   - Select a saved view and click "Delete" - should prompt for confirmation

## Expected Results

✅ **Visibility**: Buttons are much more prominent with text labels
✅ **Size**: Buttons are normal size, not small
✅ **Styling**: Primary button uses brand color (#0d1a80)
✅ **Hover**: Smooth hover effects with lift and shadow
✅ **Responsive**: Text hides on mobile but buttons remain functional
✅ **Functionality**: All save/load/delete operations work as before
